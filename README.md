# RBWR Thingy
An unfinished calculator that does two things as of now

## MWe to APR conversion
Can convert MWe demand and plant usage to a more or less approximate APR target (Â±3% give or take).\
Will also show an approximate feedwater flow, which should also be treated as a rough approximation.
## Pump repairs on high load
Allows to calculate whether you can run without a pump without changing your load.\
Pretty precise I would say, at least it worked for unit 1 when I was testing it on a private server.

## Credits
[This guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Irwh4lIR1y15hKauZ3XupzsZ79sPYgwSfMnnWt8aulc/edit) by Avalakaba (@kopa_tel_oflain) for MCC formula\
[This website](https://nxrvi.github.io/rbwrmultitoolweb/) from which I shamelessly stole MWe to APR formula.

## Downloads
Check releases for precompiled app or build it yourself from source.\
You need .Net Framework v4.8.1 to compile it.
